# Sanitarr

**Sanitarr** is a Node.js utility designed to monitor and audit downloads managed by automated media services such as **Radarr**, **Sonarr**, and **Lidarr**. It ensures the integrity of your media library by identifying and flagging failed imports or potentially unsafe and unsupported files‚Äîsuch as executables, obscure archive formats, or content with missing extensions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Sanitarr supports configuration via:
- An environment variable named `OPTIONS_FILE` pointing to a JSON configuration file
- Direct environment variables (which override the file values)

### Example Configuration (`OPTIONS_FILE`):

```json
{
    "RADARR_ENABLED": "yes",
    "RADARR_URL": "http://127.0.0.0:7878",
    "RADARR_KEY": "your_radarr_api_key",

    "SONARR_ENABLED": "yes",
    "SONARR_URL": "http://127.0.0.0:8989",
    "SONARR_KEY": "your_sonarr_api_key",

    "LIDARR_ENABLED": "yes",
    "LIDARR_URL": "http://127.0.0.0:8686",
    "LIDARR_KEY": "your_lidarr_api_key",

    "DELUGE_ENABLED": "yes",
    "DELUGE_URL": "http://192.0.0.0:8112",
    "DELUGE_PASSWORD": "your_deluge_password",

    "SCAN_INTERVAL": 30,
    "BLOCKED_EXTENSIONS_FILE": "./blocked_extensions.txt",
    "FFPROBE_PATH": "null"
}
```

Use the `OPTIONS_FILE` environment variable to specify the path to this configuration file. Any configuration key can also be provided as an individual environment variable.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Sanitarr is developed with **Node.js v22.14.0**. You should install that version, or else unexpected errors might occur.

### Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/JijaProGamer/Sanitarr.git
   cd sanitarr
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Launch the application:

   ```
   OPTIONS_FILE=./options.json node index.js
   ```

## üê≥ Running with Docker

To run Sanitarr using Docker, use the following `docker-compose.yml` template:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  sanitarr:
    image: bloxxy213/sanitarr:latest
    environment:
      RADARR_ENABLED: "yes"
      RADARR_URL: "http://127.0.0.0:7878"
      RADARR_KEY: "your_radarr_api_key"

      SONARR_ENABLED: "yes"
      SONARR_URL: "http://127.0.0.0:8989"
      SONARR_KEY: "your_sonarr_api_key"

      LIDARR_ENABLED: "yes"
      LIDARR_URL: "http://127.0.0.0:8686"
      LIDARR_KEY: "your_lidarr_api_key"

      DELUGE_ENABLED: "yes"
      DELUGE_URL: "http://192.0.0.0:8112"
      DELUGE_PASSWORD: "your_deluge_password"

      SCAN_INTERVAL: "30"
      BLOCKED_EXTENSIONS_FILE: "/usr/src/app/blocked_extensions.txt"

      FFPROBE_PATH: "null"
    volumes:
      - ./blocked_extensions.txt:/usr/src/app/blocked_extensions.txt
    restart: on-failure
```

Ensure that your `options.json` and `blocked_extensions.txt` are in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` or adjust the paths accordingly.

Then start the container:

```
docker-compose up -d
```
